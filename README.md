This project explores the fascinating world of machine learning through the lens of the Iris flower dataset, one of the most famous datasets used for classification tasks. Our objective is to build a predictive model capable of distinguishing between the three species of Iris flowers — setosa, versicolor, and virginica — based on the physical dimensions of their petals and sepals. By applying machine learning techniques, we aim to uncover the patterns that define the uniqueness of each species.


The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of learning from the measurements of iris flowers and accurately classifying them into their respective species. The model's primary goal is to automate the classification process based on the distinct characteristics of each iris species.

Key Project Details:

Iris flowers have three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
These species can be distinguished based on measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
The project involves training a machine learning model on a dataset that contains iris flower measurements associated with their respective species.
The trained model will classify iris flowers into one of the three species based on their measurements.
